# Nomad Pursuit Instagram Dashboard in Python Dash

## Notes

An interactive dashboard created in Python Dash for the Instagram page @nomadpursuit.

All of the code used to create and design the dashboard has been included in this repository. However, because acquiring the data from Instagram through the use of APIs wasn't straight forward, I've put the code that pulls the data from Instagram in this Github repo.

For anyone looking to replicate the dashboard I've included csv files in the root fodler containing all of the data needed to do this, although the data types of some columns in the csv files may have changed from what Python expects because I've copied the data from PostgreSQL into Excel. The csv files have been called the same as the table name from PostgreSQL.
